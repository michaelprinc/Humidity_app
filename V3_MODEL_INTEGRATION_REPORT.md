## üîß TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### 1. Production OCR Updates (`machine_learning/production_ocr.py`)

**Key Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Auto-detection of v3 model (`seven_segment_2k_enhanced_v3_model.keras`)
- ‚úÖ Dual-head prediction support (digit + segments)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced preprocessing pipeline for v3 architecture
- ‚úÖ Combined confidence scoring using both heads
- ‚úÖ Backward compatibility with v2 models

**New Features:**
```python
# V3 Model Features
- Segment-aware preprocessing with structure-first approach
- Combined confidence = 0.7 * digit_confidence + 0.3 * segment_confidence
- Segment activation prediction (7 binary outputs)
- Enhanced morphological operations for segment cleaning
```

### 2. Enhanced Preprocessing for V3

**Structure-First Pipeline:**
- Grayscale conversion with enhanced contrast (CLAHE)
- Conservative gaussian blur (œÉ=0.5) for noise reduction
- Adaptive thresholding for binary representation
- Canny edge detection for structure awareness
- Morphological operations optimized for seven-segment displays

**Benefits:**
- Better segment boundary detection

- 10 classes (0-9)
- Softmax activation
- Primary confidence metric

**Auxiliary Head (Segment Prediction):**
- 7 binary outputs (one per segment)
- Sigmoid activation
- Structure validation
