# OCR Enhanced_v3 Performance Optimization Report

## 1. Findings
- OCR component initialized a new Tesseract instance for every recognition pass, reloading language data repeatedly.
- Custom model `enhanced_v3` was not loaded; default `eng` model reduced accuracy.
- Multiple preprocessing pipelines and engine configurations executed sequentially, compounding latency.

## 2. Changes Implemented
- Introduced persistent Tesseract worker that loads `enhanced_v3` once and is reused for all recognition tasks.
- Worker parameters are updated per configuration instead of reinitializing the engine.
- Auto-OCR interval reduced to 1s, providing quicker feedback without extra initialization cost.
- Updated validation script to leverage the same worker and custom model.

## 3. Impact
- Eliminates repeated model loading, significantly reducing CPU and memory overhead on AndroidÂ 13 devices.
- Ensures the high-quality `enhanced_v3` model is used, improving digit recognition accuracy.
- Faster recognition loop improves user experience and responsiveness.

## 4. Recommendations
- Bundle `enhanced_v3.traineddata` under `/models` in production builds.
- Consider offloading heavy preprocessing to Web Workers for further gains.
- Monitor memory usage on low-end devices and adjust interval if necessary.
